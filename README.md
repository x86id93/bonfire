# bonfire
message deletion script for Discord

# motivation
Discord stores user-generated content indefinitely, and offers no viable options to delete it.
Discord does not delete user-generated content when a user deletes their account.

If a user wants to manually delete 200,000 messages, this task takes a minimum of ~14 days as a 9-5 job.
To put it bluntly, that is unacceptable.

This project intends to give users a viable option to delete user-generated content.
